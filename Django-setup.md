# ✅ Task Management Django Project

Welcome to my personal Django learning journey!
This repo contains my Django projects and experiments, including a Task Management app and more.

---

## 🚀 Setup Instructions 

### Create Virtual Environment (Skip if already created)

```bash
python -m venv task_env
```

> 💡 This creates an isolated Python environment named `task_env`.
> ⚠️ **Note:** Activate this environment before running any Django commands.
> **Why?** Activating sets your terminal to use the isolated Python interpreter and installed packages, avoiding conflicts.

---

### 📂 Navigate to Project Folder

Open terminal (CMD/PowerShell)
Go to your project folder where `manage.py` is located:

```bash
cd path\to\task-management
```

> ⚠️ **Note:** Reactivate your virtual environment if you open a new terminal window.
> **Why?** Each new terminal session starts fresh, so previous virtual environment settings are lost.

---

### Activate Virtual Environment (Every time you open a new terminal)

**Windows:**

```bash
task_env\Scripts\activate
```

**Linux / macOS:**

```bash
source task_env/bin/activate
```

> ⚠️ **Note:** You must reactivate the virtual environment every time you open a new terminal.
> **Why?** Because without activation, your commands will run outside the virtual environment, causing package errors or using the wrong Python version.

---

### Install Django (Skip if already installed)

```bash
pip install django
```

> ⚠️ **Note:** Ensure the virtual environment is active before installing packages.
> **Why?** So that Django and other packages install only inside your project’s isolated environment, keeping your system clean.

---

### Start Django Project (Skip if already created)

```bash
django-admin startproject task_management
cd task_management
```

> ⚠️ **Note:** Activate your virtual environment before running this command.
> **Why?** To make sure Django uses the correct Python interpreter and dependencies.

---

### Run Initial Migrations (Database Setup, Skip if already applied)
```bash
python manage.py migrate
```

> ⚠️ **Note:** Make sure your virtual environment is activated before applying migrations.
> **Why?** Because migrations rely on the correct database drivers and Django version installed in your virtual environment.

---

### Create a Django App (e.g., tasks) (Skip if already created)

```bash
python manage.py startapp tasks
```

> 🔁 Repeat this step to create additional apps (e.g., `users`, `dashboard`).
> ⚠️ **Note:** Always activate the virtual environment before running Django commands.
> **Why?** So all Django commands run with the correct settings and installed packages.

---

### Run the Development Server

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

* Visit: [http://127.0.0.1:8000/](http://127.0.0.1:8000/)
* ⚠️ If you see a 404, define a view and set up your homepage in `urls.py`.

> ⚠️ **Note:** Don’t forget to activate your virtual environment before running the server.
> **Why?** Without activation, the server might crash or not find the necessary packages.

# ✅ Django Task Management System

## 🚀 What this project is about

This is a basic web app using the Django framework. It includes:

- 📌 Home and Contact pages using **views**
- 📌 A route to show tasks (`/tasks/show-task/`)
- 📌 Separate **URL config for the app**
- ✅ Demonstrates Django project → app → view → response flow

---

│   ├── urls.py              # app-specific routes
```

## ⚙️ How It Works 

🧠 Django uses a **routing system**:
- A user visits a URL like `/tasks/show-task/`
- Django checks the URL patterns in `task_management/urls.py`
- If matched, it **includes** the `tasks/urls.py`
- That file points to a **view function**
- The view sends back an **HttpResponse**

> ✅ Each `path()` connects a URL to a view function  
> ✅ `include()` allows organizing routes inside apps  
> ✅ `HttpResponse()` returns text/HTML back to browser  

---

## 📝 Views (in `tasks/views.py`)

```python
from django.http import HttpResponse

def home(request):
    return HttpResponse("Welcome Naba's Task management system")

def contact(request):
    return HttpResponse("<h1 style='color:blue;'>This is the contact page.</h1>")

def show_task(request):
    return HttpResponse("<h1 style='color:green;'>This is the show task page.</h1>")
```
All views return HttpResponse

---

## 🔗 URL Routing 

### 🧩 Project-level (task_management/urls.py)
```python
urlpatterns = [
    path("home/", home),
    path("contact/", contact),
    path("tasks/", include("tasks.urls"))  # goes to app-level routes
]
```

### 🧩 App-level (tasks/urls.py)
```python
urlpatterns = [
    path("show-task/", show_task)  # final path → /tasks/show-task/
]
```

---

## 💡 Notes & Why This Matters

- 🧠 **Separation of concerns:** URLs are organized per app
- 📂 **Reusability:** Apps can be reused or maintained separately
- 🧪 **Testing routes:** Each path is easy to test (`/home/`, `/contact/`, `/tasks/show-task/`)
- 🧰 **Practice of real-world structure** — similar to production Django apps

## ▶️ How to Run This Project

1. **Clone the repo**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/MyDjangoQuest.git
   cd MyDjangoQuest
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment**

   * Windows:

     ```bash
     python -m venv task_env
     task_env\Scripts\activate
     ```
   * Linux/macOS:

     ```bash
     python3 -m venv task_env
     source task_env/bin/activate
     ```

3. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Apply database migrations**

   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

5. **Run the development server**

   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

6. **Visit the app in your browser**
   [http://127.0.0.1:8000/home/](http://127.0.0.1:8000/home/)

## 📦 About `requirements.txt`

### What is it?

`requirements.txt` lists all Python packages (and their versions) used in this project.

### Why is it important?

* **Easy setup:** Anyone can recreate the exact environment with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
* **Dependency tracking:** Avoids version conflicts and compatibility issues.
* **Smooth deployment:** Ensures consistency between development and production environments.

### How to create it?

After activating your virtual environment, run:

```bash
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

This captures all installed packages and versions into the file.

---

## 🔍 Why This Setup?

* **Virtual Environment:** Keeps dependencies isolated to prevent conflicts.
* **requirements.txt:** Tracks exact package versions for reproducibility.
* **Migrations:** Keeps the database schema synced with your Django models.
* **URL Routing:** Connects URLs to views for proper page handling.
* **Modular Structure:** Organizes code into apps, making it manageable and scalable.

---

## 🧭 What I Learned

* How Django routes URLs to views
* Organizing URLs at project and app levels
* Creating and using virtual environments
* Managing dependencies with `requirements.txt`

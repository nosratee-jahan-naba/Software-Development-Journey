** 3  stage in github
Edit files ➔ Working Directory (Modified)
git add ➔ Staging Area (Staged)
git commit ➔ Local Repository (Committed)


1...... Working Directory
This is where you edit or create files.
Changes here are called “Modified”.
To move files to the staging area:

--> git add filename1 filename2
or, to add all files:
--> git add .


2..... Staging Area
Here files are marked as “Staged” and are ready to be committed.
To commit the changes:

--> git commit -m "Initial project setup done"

3.... Local Repository
After committing, files are stored in the local repository.
Always use a meaningful commit message:

--> git commit -m "Added content for file.txt, file2.txt, and file3.txt"


**** Useful Git Commands:
* Check Staging Area status:
--> git status

* View all commit messages:
--> git log

* Short view of commit messages:
--> git log --oneline

* delete file
Delete ➔ Add ➔ Commit
 1.  Delete the file from your working directory -> normal delete 
 2. Then stage the deletion--> git add file2.txt
 3. Finally commit the deletion--> git commit -m "Deleted file2.txt"





***** commit message
The commit message should clearly describe exactly what changes you made.
for example
Specific Message:
Added login page layout
Fixed bug in user authentication
Updated database schema for products
(These clearly tell you what was done.)


More specific = Easier for you and others to understand the commit later.
It saves time when checking git history.
